PROJECT OVERVIEW:

When it comes to tracking expenses, you can make your system as simple as collecting receipts and organizing them once a month. 
You might get a little more information from other expense tracking systems (listing them in a 
spreadsheet, using money management software or even choosing an online application), but all methods have one 
thing in common: you have to get in the habit of thinking about your expenses. It’s very easy to misplace a receipt or 
forget about any cash you spent. You may even think that a cup of coffee or a trip to the vending machine isn’t worth tracking — although those little 
expenses can add up amazingly fast. There are all sorts of opportunities to throw a kick into your plan to track expenses. You have to get in the habit of 
doing so, to reduce those lapses, and make sure that the data you’re basing financial decisions on is solid. This project will request the clients to add their 
expenses and in view of their costs ,wallet status will be refreshed which will be noticeable to the client.

Many organizations have their own system to record their income and expenses, which they feel is the main key point of their business progress. I
t is good habit for a person to record daily expenses and earning but due to unawareness and lack of proper applications to suit their privacy, lacking decision
making capacity people are using traditional note keeping methods to do so. Due to lack of a complete tracking system, there is a 2 constant overload to 
rely on the daily entry of the expenditure and total estimation till the end of the month. In this project, we are creating a cloud application, based on python,
flask,ibm db2,etc..
